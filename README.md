## My Journey To Programming
I became interested in programming at a young age when I started teaching myself HTML and designing layouts for other users on an online diary site. In college I continued pursuing this interest with computer science as one of the foci of my engineering degree. There I learned basic design principals and a few programming languages including C and Java, but never learned how to deploy my solutions outside of a classroom setting. Instead, I used my knowledge of programming and software design to further my studies in technical theater where I became adept at programming light boards.

After college I continued to use these skills as a light board programmer, light board operator, and theatrical electrician at multiple theaters. I was extremely passionate about theater, but it is unfortunately a career with very few steady positions and eventually I was forced to pursue a career change. 

Through Commercial Real Estate I found I enjoyed applying my problem-solving skills in a business setting. This was especially true when it came to analyzing and writing contracts, or developing systems to improve the efficiency of my team’s workflow. While I enjoyed my time in real estate, I felt I had reached an upper limit of what I could do in the field, and I always missed the more technical and creative aspects of my previous work. I wanted to find a place where I could incorporate those aspects and where I would always have the opportunity to continue learning and growing.

I took Codecademy’s Java course as a refresher and it rekindled my love of programming. I started exploring bootcamp options and made the decision to resign from my position so I could devote myself to studying full time using App Academy Open’s (AAO) self-paced program. Since June 2022 I have been following the AAO coursework, supplementing with other tools and research, and building personal and group projects. 

Through software development I have found a profession in which my strengths and passions combine, and where I can continually learn and improve. My goal is to leverage my diverse skills into a remote Front-End or Full-Stack Development position where I can create exciting and impactful software.
