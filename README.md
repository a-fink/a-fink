## My Journey To Programming
I became interested in programming at a young age when I started teaching myself HTML and designing layouts for other users on an online diary site. In college I continued pursuing this interest with computer science as one of the focuses of my engineering degree. There I learned basic design principals and a few programming languages including C and Java, but never learned how to deploy my solutions outside of a classroom setting. Instead, I used my knowledge of programming and software design to further my studies in technical theatre where I became adept at programming light boards.

After college I continued to use these skills as a theatrical electrician, light board programmer, and light board operator, working with multiple theatres. While I was extremely passionate about theatre, it is unfortunately a career with very few steady positions and eventually I was forced to pursue a career change. 

While considering my options for graduate school I took a real estate course and through Commercial Real Estate I found I enjoyed applying my problem-solving skills in a business setting. This was especially true when it came to analyzing and writing contracts, and in developing systems to improve the efficiency of my team’s workflow. While I learned a great deal and enjoyed many aspects of Real Estate, I always missed the technical and creative requirements of computer science and theatre.

When considering my next steps I started taking Codecademy’s Java course as a refresher which rekindled my love of programming. I started exploring bootcamp options and made the decision to resign from my position so I could devote myself to studying full time using App Academy Open’s (AAO) self-paced program. Since June 2022 I have been following the AAO coursework, supplementing with other tools and research, and building personal projects. 

Through this process I have discovered a love of JavaScript and full-stack development, and feel as though I have come full circle to a field where all of my passions and interests – programming, problem solving, and user experience – come together. My goal is to leverage my diverse skills into a remote Front-End or Full-Stack Development position where I can create exciting and impactful software.
